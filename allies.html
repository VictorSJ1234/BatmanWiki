                  <p class="members_description" id="superman_desription">
                  Superman is the sole survivor of the planet Krypton. His father, Jor-El, discovered that a nuclear chain reaction was
                  building inside Krypton that would soon shatter the entire world. Jor-El therefore had his unborn son Kal-El removed from the 
                  Kryptonian Gestation Chambers and affixed the life matrix containing Kal-El to an experimental vessel for travel through 
                  hyperspace. Jor-El launched the starcraft toward Earth just before Krypton exploded.</p>
                  
                  <p class="members_description" id="superman_desription">Superman was, in effect, born on Earth when the starcraft landed there. Jonathan and Martha Kent found the infant inside the 
                  vessel and brought him to their farm in Smallville, Kansas. Since he appeared entirely human, the Kents assumed that the baby 
                  was a victim of a cruel experiment. At this time the baby had no super powers. The Kents named the infant Clark and raised him 
                  as their own son.</p>

                  <p class="members_description" id="superman_desription">As clark grew older his Kryptonian body began developing superhuman abilities. When Clark was eighteen, took him to the field 
                  where his starcraft still lay hidden and explained how he and Martha had found him. Clark resolved to use his powers from then 
                  on only for the good of mankind. After revealing his secret to his childhood friend, Lana Lang, Clark left Smallville to study 
                  at Metropolis University.</p>

                  One of the most beloved and iconic DC Super Heroes of all time, Wonder Woman has stood for nearly eighty years as

                  Paradise Island, Diana is an Amazon, like the figures of Greek legend, and her people's gift to humanity.</p>

                      jump. She has come to represent the possibility and potential of life without war, hate or violence, and she is a beacon of 
                      hope to all who find themselves in need. She stands as an equal among the most powerful Super Heroes, with a sense of purpose 
                      to protect the world from injustice in all forms.
                      Diana's job, however, is anything but easy. Constantly torn between her mission to promote peace and her need to fight back 
                      against the pervasive violence of her new home, Diana struggles to walk a line between her warrior strength and endless compa

                      The mysterious power known as the Speed Force is an energy field that has, over the centuries, granted incredible powers of 
                      velocity to certain heroes. The most famous of these is the Flash, also known as the Fastest Man Alive. Ever since the days 
                      of World War II, there has been a man clad in red who can run at impossible speeds, using his power to save lives and defend 
                      those who cannot defend themselves. All between the ticks of a second.</p>
                  
                  <p class="members_description" id="flash_description">In the 1940s, college student Jay Garrick acquired his super-speed 
                      abilities in a random lab accident and became the first DC Super Hero to go by the name the Flash. Years later, Jay was 
                      succeeded by police scientist Barry Allen, until Barry’s former kid partner Wally West took up the mantle at a time when 
                      Barry was considered dead. But, when Barry returned, he became the Flash once again. All three generations of speedsters 
                      have been cornerstone members of both the Justice Society and Justice League.</p>

                  <p class="members_description" id="flash_description">The Flash has mastery over not just speed, but time itself, and he has 
                      often used his powers to travel though different eras and even into other dimensions. Although the Flash has not always been 
                      fast enough to outrun personal tragedy when it has come for him, he always does his best to prevent the same from happening to
                      the people of Central City and Keystone City. In so doing, he's earned himself a spot among the greatest Super Heroes the
                        DC Universe has ever known.</p>

                      Part man, part machine, Vic Stone is a former member of the Teen Titans and a current member of the Justice League who 
                      wrestles to preserve his humanity with every new upgrade.
                      Although he always exhibited a genius level intellect, young Victor Stone didn’t want a life dedicated to science and 
                      research like his parents. Instead, Vic dreamed of being a football player, and devoted all of his time to becoming a 
                      star athlete while he was still in high school. But a tragic twist of fate that should have left him dead instead found 
                      him becoming part man and part machine—a Cyborg.</p>
                  
                  <p class="members_description" id="cyborg_description">Saved by his scientist father after an accident left very 
                      little of Victor’s body intact, Dr. Silas Stone used all of his advanced scientific knowledge to save his only child’s
                      life, and to rebuild him into a superior being, one that was arguably now more machine than man. As a cyborg, Vic was
                        now far stronger than the average person,  could interface with computers, and emit various types of energy that made 
                        him a formidable fighter. Although he ultimately chose the path of the superhero, Victor never fully acclimated to being 
                        only partially human. He always carried a sadness within him as he mourns for the normal life he never had.</p>

                  <p class="members_description" id="cyborg_description">One of the planet’s greatest heroes, Cyborg nevertheless puts 
                      all of his internal struggles aside when the time comes to save innocent lives and protect the Earth. Because of 
                      his ability to interface with computer systems, perhaps there is no hero more fitting for this modern, digital age.</p>
