            <h2 id="header1">THE DARK KNIGHT</h2>
            <p id="p1" class="p">&emsp;<strong>Batman</strong> is a superhero published by DC Comics. Operating in Gotham City, 
                he serves as its protector, using the symbol of a bat to strike fear into the hearts of criminals. 
                Unlike other superheroes, Batman is often depicted to lack "superpowers", instead using lifelong training and equipment to fight crime. 
                His secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a rich playboy and philanthropist who swore to fight crime after witnessing his parents' brutal murder. 
                He has served as a member of various teams, including the Justice League, the Justice Society of America and the Outsiders. 
                Batman is also the founder and leader of various teams, including the Batman Family, Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated.
                He also goes by numerous nicknames, including "The Dark Knight", "the Caped Crusader", "World's Greatest Detective" 
                and the "Defender of Gotham".

            <p id="p2" class="p">&emsp;Co-created by artist <strong>Bob Kane</strong> and writer <strong>Bill Finger</strong>, Batman made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939).
                He quickly became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own comic publication a year after his debut. 
                As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic 
                associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots,
                culminating in Frank Miller's 1986 Dark Knight series. It and the success of director Tim Burton's 1989 Batman motion picture helped
                reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman is often considered one of the most well-known and popular 
                superheroes of all-time. He has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media ranging from live-action television and film,
                various forms of animation, and video games.
